SECURITY (DEBIAN / Ubuntu)
==========================

1) The mDNS (multicast DNS) service is running. This service can be used by an attacker to obtain technical information that could be used to further compromise the host.  We recommend that this service is turned off if it isnâ€™t needed.  If the service is needed then all incoming traffic to UDP port 5353 should be filtered by a software firewall to allow only permitted connections.

To solve: (DONE FOR IAH522)
File: /etc/default/avahi-daemon
# 1 = Try to detect unicast dns servers that serve .local and disable avahi in                                                    
# that case, 0 = Don't try to detect .local unicast dns servers, can cause                                                        
# troubles on misconfigured networks                                                                                              
AVAHI_DAEMON_DETECT_LOCAL=0

Then: sudo service avahi-daemon restart




DISABLING DAEMON SERVICES
=========================
(http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch3.en.html#s-disableserv)
You either remove the package providing the program for that service or you remove or rename the startup links under /etc/rc${runlevel}.d/.

# ROUND LEVELS
update-rc.d -f service remove
update-rc.d name stop XX 2 3 4 5 .



delete services in 
# SERVICES
/etc/init.d/
