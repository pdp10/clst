# This command rsync's files from the remote server to the local server.
# Flags:
#   -z enables gzip compression of the transport stream.
#   -e enables using ssh as the transport prototcol.
#   --rsync-path lets us pass the remote rsync command through sudo.
#   --archive preserves all file attributes and permissions.
#   --exclude-from points to our configuration of files and directories to skip.
#   --numeric-ids is needed if user ids don't match between the source and
#       destination servers.
#   --link-dest is a key flag. It tells the local rsync process that if the
#       file on the server is identical to the file in ../$YESTERDAY, instead
#       of transferring it create a hard link. You can use the "stat" command
#       on a file to determine the number of hard links. Note that when
#       calculating disk space, du includes disk space used for the first
#       instance of a linked file it encounters. To properly determine the disk
#       space used of a given backup, include both the backup and it's previous
#       backup in your du command.
#
#
#
# The "rsync" user is a special user on the remote server and client. 
# ON THE SERVER, the "rsync" user has permissions to run 
# a specific rsync command as sudo. 
# $sudo visudo
# 
# Add at the end " rsync   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rsync "
#
# This is only required in a server to be backed up (e.g. iah372) or in a backup-server configuration (e.g. iah372backup).
# It is *NOT* required in a client configuration (e.g. iah530) that needs to be cloned from a server (e.g. iah372).
#
# Of course rsync@client needs to login passwordless to his account on the server. However, since it is root@client 
# who rsyncs through the rsync@server (the command will be `sudo rsync .... rsync@server`), we need to pass 
# a root@client RSA public key to rsync@server.
# To do this, simply create a password-less SSH key using root (sudo -i). 
# Then edit the file /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to represent rsync@client . Then add this public key 
# to the ./ssh/authorized_keys of the rsync@server.
# 
# In this way, the user "rsync" on the client can log to rsync@server through 'sudo', skipping the password.
# Actually, we achieve a 'root rsync' avoiding a full root ssh connection.


# Only run rsync if $SOURCE responds.
